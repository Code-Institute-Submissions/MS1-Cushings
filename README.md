# Milestone 1 project:
Cushing Syndrome
A personal account of living with a dog with an incurable illness.


# UX:
This website is aimed at users who maybe think that their dog has this illness but they want some more information on what
they should be looking out for, from someone who has witnessed it first hand.
As the veterinary process can be very costly it's better to get as much information beforehand.


# Wireframes:
I sketched out a basic idea of how i wanted the site to look, with a simple one page scroll and links to three other 
information pages. 


# Features:
The main page has a hero image and bold callout message with nav links & hover bar to other pages at the top.
When you scroll down you get some personal information & pictures plus the footer with social links.
Each of the link pages share the same theme with pictures, navbar and social links in footer.

# Deployment:
I used the Gitpod IDE to write the code, linked with Github it gives easy access to commit and push files to the repository. 
The deployed website is hosted on Github pages, this was achieved via the repo's settings into source then select publishing source.
To run the code locally: in repo click clone/download button, change location to where wanted, enter 'git clone' and paste url.
